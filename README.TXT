This is a mini utility program that I'm writing for practice. It's not intended for actual use. 

Includes the pdfplumber, pandas modules.

1) Feed a pdf file with multiple pages of Twitter invoices.
2) Extract information.
  a) Supplier name: Twitter inc
  b) Customer name
  c) Twitter Campaign ID
  d) Amount for each Campaign ID's
  e) Tax amount
  f) Total amount including tax
  g) Supplier sales tax registration number
  h) Invoice date
  i) Invoice number
3) Create a Pandas DataFrame.
4) Merge with other databases.
